For this to happen karthi_device has to be registered with VFS, since VFS is responsible for switching application requests to driver, we need to register addresses of the functions with VFS\n",

    "3. In struct file_operations you can find all the operations supported on a file, in our device_file we provide our own implemenatation for operations supported by creating an instance of type file_operations and assigining the pointers to the address of our functions.\n",
    "4. Bricreate the instance of file_operations and initialized the pointers of file_operations to the operations of our driver. \n",
